# zx81-fly-low-hit-hard-game
A sideways scrolling flight game similar to defender
 
to build requires tasm to be installed and the zxasm wrapper (see here for info https://perfectlynormalsite.com/zx81qstart.html )

The main code is in fly.asm and the ground definition is in vars.asm

Currently only tested on 16K zx81 emulator called EightyOne and the real 16K ZX81 with joystick interface.
